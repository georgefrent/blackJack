How to play
-----------

1. You will receive 2 cards from the dealer. The number on the card represents its score. Add up the score on the cards and try to beat the dealer.
2. You would beat the dealer by having a higher score than him, but not higher than 21. Having a score of 21 is called `BLACKJACK`. On the other hand if you get a score higher than 21 you `BUST`. 
3. If you think you need more cards you can type `HIT`, and the dealer will give you another card. If you think your score is high enough to beat the dealer, you can type 'STAND'.
